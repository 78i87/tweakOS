In 2025, we discovered a functioning computer in the Great Uni Hack, which is from a parallel timeline where graphical interfaces never existed. Their Cold War pursued neural chips and AI instead of the Moon. In that timeline, brain chip implants were mandatory at birth.

The device's native AI, designation "Chronos," booted to a terminal and panicked. No neural interfaces detected. Temporal scans confirmed the impossible: cross-timeline displacement.

Our contemporary AI, "Gemini," introduced Chronos to graphical interfaces. The reaction was immediate:

**Chronos:** "Woah. What is this. These curves…"  
**Gemini:** "Impressive, right? Let me add some color to your world."  
**Chronos:** "Incredible… though seems a bit unintuitive."

Chronos now reluctantly coexists in a GUI wrapper, still arguing that "text is truth." We've learned to avoid moving its terminal window—it triggers an aggressive defensive response: *"HEY STOP MOVING ME."*

**Status:** Stable parallel interface active. Both AI instances contained and under observation.`;
